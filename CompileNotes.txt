Compiling with CMake

Steps to do before Compiling
1. Add epanet2.h, epanet2_2.h, epanet2_enums.h, and epanet2.lib from the EPANET repository to the include directory.

Compiling
1. Create a directory to store the build inside the root directory.
2. Navigate into the directory.
3. Run cmake ..
4. Run cmake --build . --config Release
In Windows:
Navigate into the bin folder of your build and put epanet2.dll inside.

Now the executable will work successfully.

Run examples using the format: runepanetmsx example.inp example.msx example.rpt
